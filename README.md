#Artificial-Intelligence
Solutions to projects in Berkeley CS188 Artificial Intelligence

This was a free course offered at edx.org as an introduction to artificial intelligence. This repo contains solutions to the three projects assigned. Each project is showcased as a Pacman game where the student implements algorithms to win the game.

After cloning this repo, you can follow the links of each project to find in each project folder where the algorithms are implemented. All of the solutions are implemented by me and can be found under: "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***" of specific files.

You can also work through the problems yourself! The project description also shows you how to run various game simulations so you can see the AI algorithms in action before your very eyes :)

# Project 1 - Search
## Project 1 description

This project deals with search algorithms in AI. The implemented search algorithms will help Pacman traverse through the game board.

### This project covers:

Depth First Search
Breadth First Search
Uniform Cost Search
A* Search
Heuristic Techniques
